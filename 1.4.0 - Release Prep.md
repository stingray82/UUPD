**1.4.0 — GitHub Releases improvements + private asset support**

**Added**

- GitHub Releases “mode” with repo-root auto-detection (`mode: auto|json|github_release`)
- Private-safe GitHub release asset downloading via the GitHub API asset endpoint
- Optional `github_asset_name` to select the preferred release zip (defaults to `<slug>.zip`)
- Automatic GitHub auth header injection for downloads when a token is present
- Add slug return to debug to allow filtering of plugins to debug 

**Changed**

- GitHub auto-detection now triggers **only** when `server` is a repo root URL (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`)
- The updater now accepts multiple common package fields: `download_url`, `package`, `download_link`, and `download_uri`.
- Plugin/theme update injection and the “View details” modal both use the resolved package URL.
- Extra debug output (when updater debug is enabled) shows the resolved download link to make troubleshooting easier.

**Compatibility / Upgrade Notes**

- Standard JSON and repo-root GitHub setups should continue working unchanged.
- If you previously used a non-root GitHub URL in `server`, set `mode` to `github_release`.
- When a GitHub token is configured, requests to `github.com` / `api.github.com` may include auth headers (required for private repos/assets and rate limits).
